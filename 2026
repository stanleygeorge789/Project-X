Decide once. Act once. Stop negotiating.
Accept being misunderstood, without correcting.
Withdraw, don’t perform.
Protect your self-respect over your image.
Build forward immediately.
No post-mortems.
Man closes doors and accepts consequences.
Stop managing other people’s opinions.
Approval feels good short term.
Dignity feels right long term.
Men state and stop.
Move forward, not sideways.
Man doesn’t need the last word.
Build life elsewhere.
Kill the guilt reflex.
Make sure pattern never repeats.
Decide once. Don’t renegotiate.
Stop explaining yourself
