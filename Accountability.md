Accountability = Self-Respect

Scenario: 
You decide you will study 3 hours a day for your German B2 goal. If you follow through, even when tired or distracted → you prove to yourself that your own words matter.
This builds self-respect, because you can trust yourself. If you don’t follow through, repeatedly → you learn that your own commitments mean nothing. This erodes self-respect, because you lose trust in yourself.

Why the formula works: 
When you hold yourself accountable to your promises:

Your actions = Your values

And when your actions match your values, self-respect automatically grows.
