"My value is in skills delivered, not paperwork."
Questioning if the move was a mistake
"I evaluate decisions through outcomes over time, not moments."
Standing at an immigration crossroads
"I choose paths that balance compliance, growth, and contribution."
Getting an ML job but feeling underprepared day one
"I ramp fast by studying the codebase, data flow, and metrics first."
Being offered only low-paying ML roles
"I evaluate roles by learning curve and responsibility, not title alone."
Being typecast as support, not core ML engineer
"I ask for ownership of model components and deliver measurable results."
Peers converting faster through referrals
"I focus on performance signals I can control."
Failing ML system design questions
"I improved by practicing end-to-end ML pipelines and trade-offs."
Realizing production ML differs from coursework
