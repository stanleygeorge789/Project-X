LEVEL 0 ... Ownership & Delivery Identity
Purpose ... Establish the BA as the owner of delivery outcomes, not a documentation intermediary.
0.1 Accountability Mindset
....... Definition of BA Accountability in Managed Services
........... Difference between responsibility and ownership
........... Accountability across build, test, and run phases
....... Accountability Boundaries
........... What the BA owns vs what the BA influences
........... Where “not my role” becomes failure
....... Outcome-Based Accountability
........... Measuring success via operational outcomes
........... SLA, stability, and usability as success metrics
....... Accountability During Incidents
........... BA role in P1 / Major Incident scenarios
........... Decision-making under pressure
....... Accountability Across Time
........... Ownership beyond go-live
........... Handling regression, rework, and audit findings
0.2 Ambiguity Elimination
....... Sources of Ambiguity
........... Stakeholder language vs system reality
........... Implicit assumptions and tribal knowledge
....... Techniques to Surface Ambiguity
........... Rule decomposition
........... Scenario expansion
........... Edge-case interrogation
....... Writing to Eliminate Interpretation
........... Deterministic language standards
........... One-requirement–one-behavior principle
....... Ambiguity Risk Management
........... Identifying high-risk ambiguous areas
........... Prioritizing clarification based on SLA and security impact
....... Ambiguity in Agile Environments
........... Managing evolving requirements without losing precision
........... Preventing “we’ll figure it out later” failures
0.3 Ops-First Responsibility
....... Understanding Operations Reality
........... 24×7 support constraints
........... Shift-based execution and handovers
....... Designing for the 2 AM Scenario
........... Decision-making under fatigue
........... Reduced context availability
....... Protecting Operations from Bad Design
........... Identifying requirements that overload ops
........... Automation vs manual control trade-offs
....... Ops Feedback Integration
........... Capturing and incorporating operational pain points
........... Closing the loop post-incident
....... Ops-Safe Documentation Standards
........... Writing for on-call readability
........... Playbook-style clarity
0.4 Failure Ownership Principle
....... Redefining Failure
........... Functional success vs operational failure
........... Silent failures and delayed impact
....... Failure Anticipation
........... Identifying likely failure modes
........... Designing for degradation and fallback
....... Failure Traceability
........... Linking failures back to requirements
........... Post-incident requirement audits
....... Failure Communication
........... Transparent reporting during incidents
........... Avoiding blame-shifting language
....... Continuous Improvement Through Failure
........... Turning incidents into requirement improvements
........... Institutionalizing lessons learned
0.5 Section Exit Criteria (Pass / Fail)
....... A BA passes Section 0 if:
........... Ops trusts their documents
........... Ambiguity is proactively eliminated
........... Incidents don’t reveal requirement gaps
........... Accountability is visible, not claimed
........... Fail here → no progression to Section 1.
